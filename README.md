# Credit-Card-Checker


This project involved verifying various Credit card number arrays. Some were valid and some were invalid, and these can be logged to the console to validate using a function I created.

The Lohn's algorithm was used within this project to validate the credit card numbers, please see the source code for more info.

Also, invalid card numbers were found and returned using a new array created, and a validateCred function. 

Furthermore, the first digit of credit card numbers belonged to various companies. If it did not belong to a company then an error message was logged.
This function can be found within the source code.
