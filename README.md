# Credit-Card-Checker


This project involved verifying various Credit card numbers from different Banks. Some were valid and some were invalid, and these can be logged to the console to validate using functions I created. The result would therefore be true or false.

The Luhn's algorithm was used within this project to validate the credit card numbers, please see the link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/luhn-algorithm/ for more information.

Invalid card numbers were found within a batch and returned using a new array created, and a validateCred function. 

Furthermore, the first digit of credit card numbers belonged to various companies. If it did not belong to a company then an error message was logged. This function can be found within the source code.
